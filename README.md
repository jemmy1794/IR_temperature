# IR_temperature — Quick Start

A tiny, beginner-friendly Arduino project to read non-contact temperature from an IR sensor and print it (optionally serve a simple web UI on ESP boards).

Quick highlights
- Read object & ambient temps from an IR sensor (e.g. MLX90614 / MLX90632)
- Outputs to Serial (and an optional simple HTML UI if using an ESP)
- Small, easy-to-follow Arduino sketch meant for learning and hacking

What you need
- Arduino Uno/Nano or ESP board (specify which you use)
- IR temp sensor module (MLX90614, MLX90632, or similar)
- Jumper wires, USB cable, breadboard (optional)

Wiring (I2C common)
- VCC -> 3.3V or 5V (check module)
- GND -> GND
- SDA -> A4 (Uno/Nano) or board's SDA
- SCL -> A5 (Uno/Nano) or board's SCL

Software
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- Wire library (builtin)
- Sensor library (install via Library Manager; check the sketch includes)

Quick install & run
1. Open the sketch in Arduino IDE.
2. Install the library mentioned in the top of the .ino file.
3. Select board & port, then Upload.
4. Open Serial Monitor at the baud rate in the sketch (commonly 9600 or 115200).

Usage
- Power it, point sensor at object, read values in Serial Monitor.
- For ESP web UI: connect to board IP in browser (if sketch serves pages).

Calibration & tips
- IR measures surface temp. Emissivity & distance matter.
- For better accuracy: use known-emissivity targets, keep distance fixed, compare with a thermometer and apply a software offset if needed.

Troubleshooting (fast)
- No data: check wiring, power level, and I2C address (run an I2C scanner).
- Wrong values: check emissivity, reflections, or sensor config.
