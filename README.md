# IR_temperature

An Arduino-based, easy IR temperature playground.

## Overview

IR_temperature is a small, beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how to read non-contact temperature measurements with an infrared (IR) sensor and an Arduino-compatible board. The repository contains Arduino sketch(es) (C++) and an optional HTML UI for viewing readings (if present in the repo).

This README provides setup instructions, wiring guidance, usage examples, and tips for calibration and troubleshooting.

## Features

- Read IR temperature from a non-contact IR sensor
- Print temperature to the Serial Monitor
- (Optional) Serve a simple HTML interface to display readings (if included)
- Simple, easy-to-understand Arduino code suitable for learning and extension

## What you need

Minimum hardware (example — update to match your actual hardware):
- Arduino Uno, Nano, or other compatible board
- IR temperature sensor (e.g., MLX90614, MLX90632, or similar) — replace with the sensor you are using
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)
- USB cable to program the Arduino

Note: Replace the sensor example above with the exact module used in this repo. If you're unsure which sensor the code targets, check the Arduino sketch (.ino/.cpp) for the sensor driver includes (e.g., `Adafruit_MLX90614.h`, `Wire.h`, etc.).

## Wiring

Example wiring for a typical I2C IR temperature sensor (MLX90614). Adjust for your sensor and board:

- VCC -> 3.3V or 5V (check sensor voltage requirements)
- GND -> GND
- SDA -> A4 (Uno/Nano) or SDA pin on your board
- SCL -> A5 (Uno/Nano) or SCL pin on your board

If your board uses different pins for I2C (e.g., Leonardo, Due, ESP32), wire to the board's I2C pins.

## Software / Libraries

- Arduino IDE (or PlatformIO)
- Wire library (built-in)
- Sensor-specific library (install via Library Manager)
  - Examples:
    - Adafruit MLX90614 Library
    - SparkFun MLX90614 Arduino Library
    - MLX90632 library

Check the Arduino sketch for the exact include lines and install the matching library.

## Install & Upload

1. Install the Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or PlatformIO/VSCode.
2. Install the required Arduino libraries via Library Manager or from the sensor vendor's GitHub.
3. Open the sketch (.ino) in the Arduino IDE.
4. Select your board and serial port from Tools > Board and Tools > Port.
5. Verify and Upload.
6. Open Serial Monitor at the baud rate defined in the sketch (commonly 9600 or 115200) to view readings.

If the repository includes an HTML UI:
- If the project serves the page from the Arduino (e.g., using an ESP board), open the board's IP in a browser.
- If the HTML is a static file, open it locally in a browser or host it with a simple static server.

## Usage

- Power up the sensor and Arduino.
- Read temperature values in the Serial Monitor or web UI.
- Typical output includes ambient temperature and object temperature (depends on sensor).
- Point the sensor at the object to measure; keep consistent distance for repeatable results.

## Calibration & Accuracy

- IR sensors measure surface temperature; emissivity and distance affect accuracy.
- For best results:
  - Use targets with known emissivity or adjust emissivity setting in code if supported.
  - Keep a consistent distance from the sensor to the target.
  - Compare readings to a thermometer and apply offsets in software if needed.

## Troubleshooting

- No data on Serial Monitor:
  - Verify wiring (VCC, GND, SDA, SCL).
  - Ensure the sensor and board voltage levels match (3.3V vs 5V).
  - Check the I2C address in code; some sensors use configurable addresses.
  - Use an I2C scanner sketch to detect the sensor address.
- Incorrect temperature values:
  - Verify emissivity and distance settings.
  - Replace or insulate any drafts or reflective surfaces near the target.

Notes for the repository owner:
- I added a full README template with placeholders for the exact sensor and libraries. I didn't assume a specific sensor, board variant, or baud rate — please update the "What you need", "Wiring", and "Software / Libraries" sections to match the actual hardware and code in the repo.
- If you tell me the sensor model (for example, MLX90614, MLX90632, or other), your Arduino board type, and whether the HTML in the repo is a web UI served by the board or a static viewer, I can update the README to include exact wiring diagrams, library installation commands, example output, and short usage screenshots/snippets.

Would you like me to:
- Update the README now with the exact sensor and board details (please provide them), or
- Create a concise "Quick Start" section with exact commands and example output based on the code in your repo (I can read files if you want me to)?
